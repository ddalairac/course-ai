# ðŸ§  AI Experiments in Python

This project contains Jupyter Notebooks and Python utilities for experimenting with local AI models. It includes semantic similarity examples, vector embeddings, and model testing using libraries like `transformers`, `torch`, and `sentence-transformers`.

You can use this as a playground for learning Python and trying out open-source models without cloud dependencies.
